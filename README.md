TOPA

ToiletPaper Chain v1.0.0

About Project
-------------
"TOPA is the chain that brings all toilet coins together and allows for trading between them.
We are cleaning up the blockchain industry, one-ply square at a time"

After launch, TOPA will have an integrated Discord Coin Exchange that allows you to trade coins
between platforms and even between Discord servers.

We also plan to have rain in the Discord channel that will not only provide free coins to the
community but also will disintegrate (burn) coins each rain.  This will lower the supply of TOPA.
